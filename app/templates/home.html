            <sup>1</sup> It is said that man was once but a piece of clay till a soul was breathed within him. 
            <sup>2</sup> Then he was commanded to breathe: “Breathe” and thus he did; he breathed. 
            <sup>3</sup> But man is a breathless being, constantly short of breath. 
            <sup>4</sup> Man, lost in the physical, lost in the body, lost in the mud. 
            <sup>5</sup> When will man exercise his spirit, acknowledge his soul? 
            <sup>6</sup> When will man find himself in others, and love others to love himself? 
            <sup>7</sup> He will do so when he breathes; so breathe for then there will be Rizz.
            <sup>8</sup> So let there be Rizz.

            <sup>1</sup> Will man forever curse the Temptress who gave him a sip because he now thirsts?
            <sup>2</sup> Why ever does man make an enemy of the entire world then question the ideals of trust?
            <sup>3</sup> Has ever there been a man worthy of a kiss without the initial offering of a cheek? 
            <sup>4</sup> Could ever there be a man who asks this many questions and still be loved?
